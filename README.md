# My Note Taker App

  [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)


  ## Description 
  
  This app is for people who want a place to take notes for class, meetings, etc. and have a way to store them and retrieve them later, and delete notes they no longer need.  It uses a JSON data base array as well as Node.js and Express on the back end, dynamic HTML/CSS on the front end. Our task was to complete the server.js so that all parts would deploy seemlessly to the user.
